						SHOP.COM has  successfully attracted hundreds of qualified merchants, offering  millions of unique products, all shop-able by customers using one  basket and one account. We were able to accomplish this because we  directly aligned the interest of the merchant with the interest of the  marketplace by pioneering and introducing the cost-per-order (CPO)  business model. This highly-efficient model is extremely attractive to  merchants because it gives them a completely predictable ROI (return on  investment), unlike models where they advertise to drive traffic to  their own sites and then hope to make enough sales to cover their  advertising costs.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
						We believe that a shopping venue that provides all these things all the  time - lots of choices, safety and security, trusted brands and  hard-to-find esoteric products, great prices - is compelling. And  SHOP.COM delivers all that.
