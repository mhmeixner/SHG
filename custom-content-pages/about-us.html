      <p class="common-pages-text"><span class="page_headers">A Message from our Founder</span></p>
      <p class="common-pages-text">I know, without a doubt, that family time at the table has more power than any government funded program, any million dollar initiative, or any other activity we can plug our children into. Those precious few minutes of conversation around the table can lead to better choices and decisions made by children when they are away from the home. Choices that are influenced by the voice of a mom or dad at a dinner table expressing their view of what is right and wrong; even though when those views were expressed... we were sure they went in one ear and out the other! They did not... they stuck somewhere within the mass of all the other information being fed into those precious minds. This is how we influence generational change around the dinner table!</p>
      <p class="common-pages-text">Because I believe so strongly in this, I began noticing what was keeping us as families from being able to have that simple, yet powerful mealtime together. Once I realized it was simply a matter of skill, planning and timing... I knew we could help make a difference! </p>
      <p class="common-pages-text">We took away the skill needed to prepare great tasting food. It’s so easy your children can make dinner!</p>
      <p class="common-pages-text">We created tools to do the planning for you. From prepared grocery lists to menus for a week... we have calendars and recipe pages that plan it all.</p>
      <span class="common-pages-text">We made the timing 30 minutes or less to get dinner on the table. In fact, we can show you how to prepare </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" class="common-pages-text"><a href="/4-Meals-in-4-Minutes_ep_43-1.html">4 meals in 4 minutes</a></span><span class="common-pages-text"><a href="/4-Meals-in-4-Minutes_ep_43-1.html">™</a> that can then go into the freezer for a fast grilling or a simple slow cooker meal any day of the week... no matter how busy you are! </span>
