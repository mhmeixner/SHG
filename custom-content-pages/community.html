      <td align="center"><p class="common-pages-text">Millions of children across the world are 
        forced to deal with the daily realities of
        hunger and hopelessness. Without access to
        healthy food, clean water, healthcare,
        education, and economic opportunities,  these
        children and their families become trapped  in
        an endless cycle of poverty and despair.        Homemade Gourmet® is determined to break
        this cycle and bring hope back to these
        precious children through a partnership  with
        World Vision. World Vision is an  International
        Christian humanitarian organization who
        provides assistance for the world’s poorest
        children and families in nearly 100 countries
        around the world. Homemade Gourmet®
        donates a portion of the proceeds from the
        sale of each World Vision Basic Bread for  Life
        Mix and joins with hundreds of Homemade
        Gourmet® Consultants,  employees, and
        customers in sponsoring children in
        communities in India, Guatemala, Honduras
        and other countries across the world.</p>

          <br />
          Homemade Gourmet® has also made a
          commitment to children in Malawi, Africa,
          through World Vision’s Hope Child
          Sponsorship. Homemade Gourmet® is
          striving to help meet the needs of these
          especially vulnerable children who have  lost
          one or both parents to HIV/AIDS.        In addition to sponsorships, in <a href="#" class="common-pages-text">2003</a>,          Homemade Homemade Gourmet® donated the funds to
          build a two-room schoolhouse in Asodeso,
          Guatemala. And in 2004, Homemade
          Gourmet®, World Vision and  Helps 
          International teamed up on another special
          project; a stove campaign. Hoping to  prevent
          the thousands of accidents and deaths that
          occur every year due to unsafe open fire
          cooking pits, Homemade Gourmet® donated
          one clean venting stove for every three
          purchased through World Vision. The funding
          of special projects continues to be an  ongoing
          aspect of our involvement with World  Vision.</span>          <span class="common-pages-text"><br />
          <br />
          Currently Homemade Gourmet is campaigning  to&nbsp;raise the funds to provide backpacks  filled with 
            school supplies for the children in our  nation’s 
            most distressed communities. With your help we can reach across the  globe
            and touch those who are in need.        <br />
